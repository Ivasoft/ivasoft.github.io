There are Exception, Error and Throwable at the root of Exception Handling. I have seen so many guys who are confused in checked, un-checked and runtime exceptions. Here you will go through a list of 15 questions entirely related to Exception Handling in Java.
I would also advice to go through Java Exception Handling Tutorial before jumping into interview questions directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract classes and interfaces are used in java for providing contract but what is the difference between them and when should we use interface over abstract class and vice versa is a great design question and asked a lot in java interviews. This post provides all the differences between abstract class and interface and when should we use interface over abstract class and vice versa. The post also explains how to use abstract class and interface both in conjunction to create a flexible design for providing contract for subclasses.
